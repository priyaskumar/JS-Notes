# Function declaration vs Function expression

- There're two main ways to define a function: 
    - starting with function keyword:  
        - you're creating a function declaration or statement

        - the statement will be hoisted up to the top of the file. That is, if you define function at the bottom you can use it or reference it anywhere else in that file

            ```js
            function sayHi(message) {
                return 'Said...' + message;
            }
            ```

    - create a function expression:
        - setting that function equal to a variable

        - any code above the function cannot reference the function

            ```js
            const sayHi = function(message) {
                return 'Said..'+ message;
            }
            ```
- General Rule : 

    - Declaration for global code

    - Expression for local code

- Expressions can be anonymous

# Higher Order Functions

- A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. 

- They are commonly used in functional programming

- A powerful tool for abstracting away complexity.


- Example :

    ```js
    // A function that takes a function as an argument
    function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
    }
    function subtract(x, y) {
    return x - y;
    }
    function math(x, y, operator) {
    return operator(x, y);
    }

    math(5, 2, add); // 7
    ```
# Closures

- A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. 

- JS will automatically store the state of a closure in the heap memory, even after the parent function has returned. 

- This behavior makes them useful for encapsulating private variables.

    ```js
    function encapsulatedState(x) {
        let state = 10;
        return function() {
            state += x;
            return state;
        }
    }
    ```
